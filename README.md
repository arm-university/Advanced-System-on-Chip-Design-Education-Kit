## About

Welcome to our Advanced System on Chip Design Education Kit!

Our flagship offering to universities worldwide is the Arm University Program Education Kit series.

These self-contained educational materials offered exclusively and at no cost to academics and teaching staff worldwide. They’re designed to support your day-to-day teaching on core electronic engineering and computer science subjects. You have the freedom to choose which modules to teach – you can use all the modules in the Education Kit or only those that are most appropriate to your teaching outcomes.

Our Advanced System on Chip Design Education Kit equips your students with the skills to use Arm Cortex-A based platform FPGAs as convenient tools for designing and prototyping a typical SoC. The revolution in mobile computing has been driven by the low power and integrated performance available in modern SoC designs, making these essential skills for tomorrow’s engineers. A full description of the education kit can be found [here](https://www.arm.com/resources/education/education-kits/advanced-soc).


 ## Kit specification:

* A full set of lecture slides, ready for use in a typical 10-14-week undergraduate course (full syllabus below).
* Recent updates to the EdKit include a dedicated module on an overview of HDMI for input and output and refreshed lab exercises based on the Zybo Z7-10 board.
* Lab manual with solutions for faculty. Labs are based on low-cost yet powerful Arm-based hardware platforms donated by partners (subject to availability). 
* **Prerequisites:** Basics of hardware description language (Verilog or VHDL), basic C and assembly programming.

## Course Aim
To produce students who can design, implement, and test an Arm Cortex-A-based SoCs on real FPGA hardware using high-level functional specifications, standard hardware description and software programming languages.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.
 
Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course has been updated to replace references to non-inclusive language. We recognise that some of you will be accustomed to using the previous terms and may not immediately recognise their replacements. Please refer to the following examples:

* When introducing the AMBA AXI Protocols, we will use the term ‘Manager’ instead of ‘Master’ and ‘Subordinate’ instead of ‘Slave’. 
* When introducing the architecture, we will use the term ‘Requester’ instead of ‘Master’ and ‘Completer’ instead of ‘Slave’. 

This course may still contain other references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.
 
Contact us at education@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
